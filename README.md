Analysis of Goodreads Books Dataset.


In this Repository, I have done a deep analysis of Goodreads Book Dataset. 

I have used Numpy &  Pandas and  Matplotlib, Seaborn for the visualization to find the Top 10 books, top 10 Authors, top 10 Publishers, top 10 books with highest rating and the lowest rating, most preferred language in the books etc.
